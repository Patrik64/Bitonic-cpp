bitonic application

Building and running the application
The actor implementation uses several new features from the latest c++ implementation 
(e.g. auto keyword and lambda(s)), 
and it uses the boost library.

to build the application, you'll need the following:
- cmake
- latest boost library 
- latest gcc compiler  

create a new directory called build, go to build (cd build) 
and type the following:
bitonic/build$ cmake ..
bitonic/build$ make

that should create the bitonic executable
to run, type the following:

bitonic/build$ ./bitonic
